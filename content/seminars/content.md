### Open-source e innovazione digitale: un approccio sostenibile e scalabile
- Speaker: Luca Marchino, [Labinf Sistemi](https://www.labinfsistemi.com/)
- When: Monday, May 10, 2021, 17.30 - 19.00

#### Abstract
Il software open source, progettato per essere accessibile pubblicamente, viene sviluppato con un approccio decentralizzato e collaborativo di professionisti IT e community. Il risultato è una soluzione flessibile, longeva e di qualità. L’approccio open source incoraggia la collaborazione e il contributo di ognuno, per realizzare soluzioni efficaci nei confronti di sfide complesse e in contesti di forte cambiamento.
Come può essere sostenibile, in azienda o per la didattica, l’adozione di soluzioni open source?

### The life of a Cloud Security Researcher: how to exploit a cloud environment
- Speaker: Stefano Chierici, [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/)
- When: Monday, May 3, 2021, 17.30 - 18.30

#### Abstract
Security has always been a challenge for all the companies also on-premises, but cloud-native services raises the bar. Containers offer more virtualization layers to hide an attack and Cloud removed the physical barrier increasing the misconfigurations impact. This talk will make it concrete and try a real cloud attack.
What we will do together:
 1. Identify an entrypoint
 2. Lateral Movement in the cloud
 3. Cloud Privilege Escalation
 4. Detect the intrusion

#### Short bio
**Stefano Chierici** is a security researcher in Sysdig where his research focuses on defending containerized environments and cloud environments from attacks ranging from web to kernel. Stefano is one of the Falco contributors, an incubation level CNCF project. He studied cyber security in Italy and, before joining Sysdig, he was a pentester and obtained the OSCP Certification in 2019. He was a security engineer and a red team member.

### Data pipeline orchestration via Apache Airflow
- Speaker: Matteo Senardi, [Docsity](https://www.criticalcase.com/)
- When: Monday, Apr 26, 2021, 17.30 - 19.00

#### Abstract
Docsity is social learning network for students and professionals worldwide, where it is possible to share and download study material. 
In Docsity we have millions of users coming every month that are engaged with the platform, with tens of millions interactions to be tracked. 
The exciting challenge for the Docsity data team is to create a process that allows to collect, store and activate millions of clickstreams day by day.
In Docsity we created a custom build from Docker Compose with Google Cloud Build CI/CD process to deploy new versions of Apache Airflow (an open source platform widely used to design and control data pipeline) with Google Compute Engine every time a commit is pushed on the production branch.
This talk will present how we automated the entire workflow, hence achieving a timely update of our software while keeping the entire solution stateless.


#### Short bio
**Matteo Senardi** is the Head of Data of Docsity, where he leads the team responsible for all data chain, from collection on real time clickstream, to transformations and normalizations in order to feed the data lake in Google BigQuery. This includes the datasets definitions and gathering, the development of data-pipelines or the science of making it work and their deployment in production with CI/CD.
He graduated as computer engineering in Modena. After the degree, he started working with data in the R&D department of Webranking, a digital marketing agency. He moved later to Mediaset as a senior data engineer, and then he joined Docsity.
He designs and maintains several open source projects in his [GitHub](https://github.com/pualien) account, which are currently used in production environments.

### Design and implementation of a data center network with a layer 2 extension
- Speaker: Francesco Marabotto, [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- When: Monday, Feb 8, 2021, 11.00 - 12.30

#### Abstract
Data centers are the locations where the real asset of an enterprise is stored: data.
All of the internet and most is served from a data center and most organizations rely on them to achieve their purposes.
A data center network needs to be engineered based on the services and applications requirements creating a unique design that is specific to a use case.
In this seminar I'm going to describe a scalable and reliable network suited for a large enterprise, bridging the gap between networking theory and practical implementation using real world examples of devices, features and configurations.
