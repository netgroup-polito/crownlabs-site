### API Management in Hybrid Cloud scenarios
- Speaker: Francesco Semeraro, [Cluster Azure Reply](https://www.reply.com/cluster-reply/)
- When: Tuesday, Dec 14, 2021, 10.00 - 11.30
- [Recorded video](https://youtu.be/0mSbfpS_9yY)

#### Abstract
As many organizations move to a digital enterprise model in which more and more data is exposed via APIs, an API management technology is required to alleviate the effort of maintaining multiple APIs that are produced and published within the company.
API administration technologies need to support hybrid scenarios, in which some portions of the platform are cloud-based, while others are still on-premise.
This seminar will analyse the advantages of setting up an hybrid API management solution and it will present a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation based on Azure API management.
Finally, an hands-on session will explore all the components involved in an hybrid API management solution from the Azure portal to the on-premise Kubernetes cluster.

#### Short Bio
**Francesco Semeraro** is a cloud engineer and solutions architect at Cluster Azure Reply, the Reply company focused on solutions based on Microsoft Azure. These include cloud, multi-cloud and hybrid cloud infrastructures, often based on Kubernetes clusters and Docker containers.

### Pricing models on public cloud providers
- Speaker: Federico Cicchiello, [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/)
- When: Friday, Dec 10, 2021, 8.30 - 10.00
- [Recorded video](https://youtu.be/GOcRsNC4or8)

#### Abstract
While public cloud is increasingly used, it is not always clear their cost model, as well as the different cost options available to customers.
This seminar will address the following questions:
- How much public cloud providers charge for their services?
- What are the costs of having a virtual Kubernetes cluster?
- What is the impact of each pricing component on the overall infrastructure cost?

The seminar will also present the pricing models of VMs, containers and block storage services as well as the main networking-related costs of the major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure), as well as the cluster provisioning modes and the related cost models for Kubernetes services.
Finally, the seminar will present some considerations on the relative weight of each pricing components through a cost simulation.

#### Short bio
**Federico Cicchiello** is a student in the Master Degree on Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, with a graduation thesis focusing on analysis, modeling and implementation of cost models for a multi-cloud Kubernetes scenario.

### Distributed Services at the Network Edge: Motivations, Opportunities, Technology
- Speaker: Mario Baldi, [Pensando Systems](https://www.pensando.io/)
- When: Monday, June 7, 2021, 17.30 - 19.00
- [Recorded video](https://youtu.be/mVYdQvvGQ8c)

#### Abstract
Network and security services have traditionally been deployed in front of a group of end hosts that share some common function and are topologically close: e.g., private corporate clients, public corporate servers, the servers of a specific department, the hosts of a corporate branch. With virtualization, while the same logical model still applies, the physical placement of the hosts, their physical proximity, and the natural point to deploy the service application (on the shortest path of traffic to and from the served hosts) have disappeared. Hence, this model of implementing services in a centralized fashion, can no longer be effectively applied.

At the same time, the cloud paradigm has moved all the intelligence of the network at the edge, leaving mere layer 3 connectivity to the core of the network (the so called underlay). This contributes to making the network edge a natural candidate location where to implement services.

This paradigm shift is the focus of this seminar. We start with looking into the motivations for and advantages of implementing complex network, storage and security services at the network edge, and the new opportunities this creates. In this context, we look into a platform developed by Pensando Systems, Inc. to support the execution of such services in a distributed fashion on a PCIe-attached Distributed Services Card (DSC). We analize the architecture of the ASIC that powers the DSC to see how, in order to best address this novel deployment scenario, it was designed to be fully programmable, with both domain specific and general purpose processing capability. A few use cases will be used to validate such architecture.

#### Short bio
**Mario Baldi** is Distinguished Technologist at Pensando Systems, Milpitas, CA, USA and Associate Professor of Information Processing Systems (on leave) at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. He has held various positions in startup and established companies in the computer networking industry, as well as several visiting professorships at Universities in four continents, during over 25 years of professional involvement in the computer networking domain.
