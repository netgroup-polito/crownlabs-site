#### Abstract
Data centers are the locations where the real asset of an enterprise is stored: data.
All of the internet and most is served from a data center and most organizations rely on them to achieve their purposes.
A data center network needs to be engineered based on the services and applications requirements creating a unique design that is specific to a use case.
