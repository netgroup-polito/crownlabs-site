### When Systems Break: Cloud Disaster Stories with a Silver Lining
- Speaker: Lorenzo David, [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/)
- When: Wednesday, 18 December 2024, 13:00 - 14:30

#### Abstract
Distributed cloud infrastructure provides value to organizations both organizationally and technologically, offering advantages over more traditional monolithic systems. However, the complexity of managing this infrastructure at scale, across a multi-cloud environment, is not trivial and requires a fundamental shift in the way engineers operate and ensure the reliability of the system.

In this seminar, we will provide insights into how modern cloud-based infrastructure is architected and discuss standard Site Reability Engineering (SRE) practices. We will then examine disaster scenarios, from simple breakages to more complex regional outages, and share lessons learned from real-world incidents.

#### Short Bio

### Software Driven Network Operations (in Italian)
- Speaker: Paolo Fasano, [TIM](https://www.tim.it)
- When: Friday, Jan 10, 2025, 11:30 - 14:00

#### Abstract
Le reti di telecomunicazioni moderne presentano un elevato grado di complessità dovuto ad una molteplicità di fattori che includono:
- Incremento del numero di apparati, a seguito della continua crescita del traffico;
- Eterogeneità delle tecnologie utilizzate;
- Elevata dinamicità e volatilità di utenti e servizi, con continue modifiche delle configurazioni;
- Pattern di traffico variegati e non sempre facilmente prevedibili (in particolare eventi in tempo reale);
- Problematiche di isolamento dei guasti o degli attacchi informatici.

In questo contesto, l'_Operation_ della rete (inteso come insieme di attività di creation, delivery, maintenance e assurance) vede crescere allo stesso modo il proprio livello di criticità dovendo garantire un livello elevato di disponibilità della rete e dei servizi anche in presenza dei fattori di complessità precedentemente indicati. L’automazione nelle attività di operation, per una rete di telecomunicazione moderna, quale quella di TIM, si pone quindi come una necessità intrinseca per garantire il necessario livello di efficienza e qualità dell’offerta: Software Driven Network Operations identifica questo paradigma, in cui la progressiva adozione di procedure automatiche nella prima configurazione iniziale dei nuovi apparati inseriti in rete, nella modellizzazione di servizi end to end complessi che richiedono interventi coordinati su molteplici apparati, nella raccolta di dati di prestazioni e nella loro analisi, rende possibile la rivisitazione dei processi di operation e la loro ottimizzazione in modalità proattiva e non solo reattiva.

In questo seminario viene illustrata ad alto livello l’architettura della piattaforma costruita da TIM per attualizzare il concetto di Software Driven Network Operations, attraverso la creazione di una piattaforma in casa (TIM SDN platform) a partire da componenti commerciali, componenti open source e componenti custom. L’approccio ribalta parzialmente quello dei prodotti di gestione generali disponibili sul mercato, assemblando le componenti nel sistema a partire dalle caratteristiche degli elementi di rete e delle esigenze delle diverse funzioni aziendali (approccio “use case driven”), mantenendo però un approccio sistemico nella gestione delle interazioni con gli apparati.

TIM SDN Platform include 3 macro componenti funzionali: BRAIN, WRITE, READ, incaricate rispettivamente della modellazione e dell'orchestrazione dei servizi, dell'attuazione di configurazioni e comandi, e la raccolta di dati e telemetria sullo stato dell'infrastruttura.
Nel corso del seminario saranno presentati un primo livello di dettaglio dell’architettura funzionale di queste componenti e alcuni use case sviluppati sulla TIM SDN Platform.

### Composable Disaggregated Infrastructures
- Speaker: Christian Pinto, IBM Research
- When: Friday, 10 January 2025, 16:00 - 17:30

#### Abstract
Composable Systems are a new paradigm for building computer systems that aims at improving utilization of hardware, reducing energy consumption and enables the infrastructure to dynamically adapt to different incoming workloads, rather than the way around. However, this technology is not yet the state of the art for building data centers and it requires further efforts on the hardware, software and standardization initiatives. In particular operating system, boot loaders and management software are a big area of exploration in this moment. This talk will go through the landscape of composable disaggregated infrastructure, describing existing commercial solutions and ongoing research and efforts for integrating with the cloud control data plane.

### Distributed Services at the Network Edge: Motivations, Opportunities, Technology
- Speaker: Mario Baldi, [Pensando Systems](https://www.pensando.io/)
- When: Monday, June 7, 2021, 17:30 - 19:00
- [Recorded video](https://youtu.be/mVYdQvvGQ8c)

#### Abstract
Network and security services have traditionally been deployed in front of a group of end hosts that share some common function and are topologically close: e.g., private corporate clients, public corporate servers, the servers of a specific department, the hosts of a corporate branch. With virtualization, while the same logical model still applies, the physical placement of the hosts, their physical proximity, and the natural point to deploy the service application (on the shortest path of traffic to and from the served hosts) have disappeared. Hence, this model of implementing services in a centralized fashion, can no longer be effectively applied.

At the same time, the cloud paradigm has moved all the intelligence of the network at the edge, leaving mere layer 3 connectivity to the core of the network (the so called underlay). This contributes to making the network edge a natural candidate location where to implement services.

This paradigm shift is the focus of this seminar. We start with looking into the motivations for and advantages of implementing complex network, storage and security services at the network edge, and the new opportunities this creates. In this context, we look into a platform developed by Pensando Systems, Inc. to support the execution of such services in a distributed fashion on a PCIe-attached Distributed Services Card (DSC). We analize the architecture of the ASIC that powers the DSC to see how, in order to best address this novel deployment scenario, it was designed to be fully programmable, with both domain specific and general purpose processing capability. A few use cases will be used to validate such architecture.
