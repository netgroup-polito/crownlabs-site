## Learning path
Often, university courses focus on high-level topics and fail to give students the proper practical background about the tools required for collaborative open-source development and the best practices for software development and testing.

This section contains some guides and suggestions to fill this gap, and it is oriented to all the people who would like to collaborate with an open-source project such as CrownLabs.

* [Introduction to Git/GitHub for CrownLabs](./git)

* [Introduction to Golang language](./golang)

* [Creating and modifying an operator in Kubernetes](./operator)


### Seminars and events
We organize some seminars and events to keep learning.
Look at the [Seminars](/seminars) page.
