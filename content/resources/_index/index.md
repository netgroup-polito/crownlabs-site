## Resources

This page collects a set of pointers to external resources related to the CrownLabs project.

### Videos

* [**Introduction to CrownLabs**](https://youtu.be/i7fqga7xQv0): an introductory video that presents the main characteristics of CrownLabs, plus a live demonstration of its main features. Available at https://youtu.be/i7fqga7xQv0.

* [**Getting started with CrownLabs**](https://youtu.be/zvRy1hGJpMY): a short _hands on_ video, oriented to students, showing how to use CrownLabs. Available at https://youtu.be/zvRy1hGJpMY.


### Scientific Papers

* Marco Iorio, Alex Palesandro and Fulvio Risso, "[CrownLabs — A Collaborative Environment to Deliver Remote Computing Laboratories](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136697)," in IEEE Access, vol. 8, pp. 126428-126442, 2020, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007961. Available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9136697.


### Other documentation

* [Creating Courses, Labs and User accounts](https://github.com/netgroup-polito/CrownLabs/tree/master/provisioning/courses): procedure (not yet fully automated) to set-up new courses (including multiple labs), and user (students, professors) accounts in CrownLabs.

* [Guide for creating and uploading VMs in CrownLabs](https://github.com/netgroup-polito/CrownLabs/tree/master/provisioning/virtual-machines): procedure (not yet fully automated) to create new Virtual Machine images for CrownLabs.


### Learning path
Often, university courses focus on high-level topics and fail to give students the proper practical background about the tools required for collaborative open-source development and the best practices for software development and testing.

This section contains some guides and suggestions to fill this gap and it is oriented to all the people who would like to collaborate with an open-source project such as CrownLabs.
