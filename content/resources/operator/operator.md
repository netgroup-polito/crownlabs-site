## Introduction

CrownLabs uses the Kubernetes [operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/ "operator pattern") to automate complex tasks such as the configuration and provisioning of virtual environments.
With this paradigm we can create both new _custom resources_, a set of objects that model a specific part of system (e.g., the _student_ with its own set of _attributes_), and the associated _software logic_ (e.g., the code required to _create_ a new student, _update_ or _delete_ this object, and more).
As a consequence, the implementation of additional features in CrownLabs implies dealing with operators, either modifying an existing one or creating a new one.

In CrownLabs, most operators use the [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) framework to simplify the task of generating [CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/ "CRDs"), Controllers (where the operator\'s logic resides) and the various Kubernetes manifests needed.

This page aims at providing a set of useful tips and references to start learning and practicing with operators.

This page is split in two sections, depending whether you want to create a _new_ operator from scratch or you want to modify an _existing_ one; for instance, it is very common that a new feature in CrownLabs may require modifications to existing operators instead of asking for a brand new operator.


## Prerequisites
Regardless you want to create a _new_ operator or modify an _existing_ one,  here there are the software prerequisites.

1. go version v1.13+
2. docker version 17.03+
3. kubectl version v1.11.3+
4. Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster ([kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/ "kind") or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/ "minikube") are good enough)
5. kubebuilder ([installation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation "installation"))


## Creating an operator

Useful links:
1. The [official documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html) is rather good but the example might appear far from what you want to realize.
2. This [step-by-step tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBTXBUVNF2I) on how to build an operator from scratch, after a first watch to get an overview, it might be useful to come back to it while you build the operator to look for specific parts.

Useful information to get the kubebuilder project started:
- Use `polito.it` as domain when doing `kubebuilder init` (or `example.com`  if you are just testing stuff)
- The api group should be set to `crownlabs`
- At the moment of writing CrownLabs is focused on developing the API version `v1alpha2`. Check out the repository to make sure you create your project with the right parameters.
- the `kind` option is going to be the CRD name, the generated controller will be named `<kind_name>_controller`

Sometimes you might want to create an operator that manages different kind of resources that have already been defined or simply you do not need to create a new CRD.
Kubebuilder will generate the controller code only after generating CRDs, so even if you do not really need to define a CRD just do it and you can easily get rid of it later while you have the rest of the code correctly generated.


## Writing the controller or modifying an existing operator

The kubebuilder framework uses the controller-runtime library to communicate with the Kubernetes API. The documentation of the library is sparse across different packages, here are some useful ones:
1. [controller-runtime](https://godoc.org/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime "controller-runtime") general godoc page
2. controller-runtime\'s [client](https://godoc.org/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client "client") used to interact with the k8s API
3. the [buider](https://godoc.org/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/builder "buider") used in the `SetupWithManager` function to select which resources to watch
4. the [request](https://godoc.org/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/reconcile#Request "request") received in the reconciler function
5. k8s [corev1](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/api/core/v1 "corev1") in case you need to interact with core k8s kind (pods, deployments, configmaps etc)


## Notes

You might notice that the structure in the CrownLabs repository is different from the one generated by kubebuilder. However, this is not a big deal:
- `main.go` goes inside its own folder inside `operators/cmd/<operator-name>`
- `<kind>_controller.go` goes in `operators/pkg/controllers/<kind>_controller.go`
- CRD manifests go inside `operators/deploy/crds/`
- operator\'s deployment goes inside its own folder inside `operators/deploy/<operator-name>`
