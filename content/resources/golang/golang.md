## Introduction

Crownlabs backend is written in Golang (a.k.a. Go), an open source, procedural programming language created by Google. To simplify it can be compared with C and C++ but without some of their most tricky issues (e.g. memory management). This guide will do a general excursus on this very raising language introducing its most relevant features, giving a roadmap to follow to learn it.

### Install Go

The first step is to install Go and it can be done easly [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Ides and editor plugins

To write code in Go there are some ides like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) and text editor plugins like [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go).
For newbie students of Go the best is *Goland* which also has some mini tutorials of editing with code examples.

## Start learning Go

### Suggestions

Since Go is similar to other famous programming language (e.g. C/C++) it is very simple to learn sintax and for this purpose you can use [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) which is very simple and clear with a lot of tutorials and examples.
