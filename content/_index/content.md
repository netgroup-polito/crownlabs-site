CrownLabs provides immediate access to your **remote computing labs**, without any special requirements: just a **browser**!

Do not pollute your laptop with all the tools required by your subjects: connect to your remote environment, with everything **ready to go**, already set up.

You can also cooperate with your **groupmates**, sharing the same working environment and allowing both to operate at the same time.

And, when you are lost, you can ask your **instructor** for help: he can operate in your working environment as well, instantly.

You do no longer have to be in the same physical location with your groupmates and the instructor: you can be **anywhere**, thanks to CrownLabs!
